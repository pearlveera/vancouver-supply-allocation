# vancouver-supply-allocation

This is a research project I completed in Introduction to Operations Research at Simon Fraser University in collaboration with 3 other group members from the class. 

Abstract: This paper aims to outline a supply plan that outfits 25 support hubs in the City of Vancouver with essential food and water supplies in the event of a natural disaster. We propose a model that takes as input the population, population distribution, percentage of population that requires assistance, number of days to supply, number of cans and bottles per day, Costco weekly capacity constraints, cost of gas per kilometre for the chosen vehicle, and carrying capacity of chosen vehicle. The model then proposes a supply plan that outfits the hubs with the necessary amount of supplies at the least cost in the least amount of time.

This project is slated for publication in the next issue of the SFU undergraduate Operations Research journal "Analytics Now".
